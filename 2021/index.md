### Abstract

In recent years, the optimization and computational intelligence methods have achieved remarkable results in domains including robotics, games, circuit design, and large-scale scheduling engine. This workshop will bring together researchers working at the field of optimization, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation, and it will also cover the cutting-edge research both in academic and industrial communities. It aims to help interested researchers both inside and outside of the field gain a high-level view about the current state-of-the-art works and potential directions and applications for future.

### Attending the Workshop
The workshop will be hosted at Tactic C, Aloft Shanghai Zhangjiang Haike (上海张江海科雅乐轩酒店).

## Submission Instructions

~~tl;dr: Please submit via the workshop OpenReview submission page at [https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2021/Workshop/MetaLearn](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2021/Workshop/MetaLearn).~~ The submission period has now passed.

### Important Dates

- Submission deadline: [September 29th, 2021, 11:59 PM AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=MetaLearn%40NeurIPS+2021+Submission+Deadline&iso=20210929T235959&p1=3926)
- Author Notification: October 22nd, 2021, AoE
- Video recording to SlidesLive: November 1st, 2021, AoE
- Camera-ready submission (paper + poster) to OpenReview: November 29th, 2021, AoE
- Workshop: December 13th, 2021

### Formatting

We have provided a modified `.sty` file [here](neurips_2021.sty) that appropriately lists the name of the workshop when `\neuripsfinal` is enabled. Please use this style file in conjunction with the corresponding LaTeX `.tex` template from the [NeurIPS website](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) to submit a final camera-ready copy. Both the submission and the camera-ready can be up to **8 pages** (excluding references) **and we explicitly encourage submitting works shorter than 8 pages** (e.g., works that may show preliminary but novel results).

### Publication

Accepted papers and supplementary material will be made available on the workshop website. However, these do not constitute archival publications and no formal workshop proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish their work in archival journals or conferences.

### FAQ

1. Can supplementary material be added beyond the 8-page limit for submissions, and are there any restrictions on it?

   Yes, you may include additional supplementary material, but you should ensure that the main paper is self-contained, since looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. The supplementary material should also follow the same NeurIPS format as the paper.
   
1. Are references included in the 8-page limit?
   
   No, references will not count towards the page limit.

1. Can a submission to this workshop be submitted to another NeurIPS workshop in parallel?

   We discourage this, as it leads to more work for reviewers across multiple workshops. Our suggestion is to pick one workshop to submit to.

1. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that has already appeared at a previous conference with published proceedings?

   We won't be accepting such submissions unless they have been adapted to contain significantly new results (where novelty is one of the qualities reviewers will be asked to evaluate).

1. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that is currently under review or will be under review at a conference during the review phase?

   From our side, it is perfectly fine to submit a condensed version of a parallel conference submission if it is also fine for the conference in question. Our workshop does not have archival proceedings, and therefore parallel submissions of extended versions to other conferences are acceptable.
  
## Review Process

tl;dr: The review process will be **double-blind**. ~~Please sign up to be, or recommend, a reviewer via [https://forms.gle/EW4icbYv5uA8A13KA](https://forms.gle/EW4icbYv5uA8A13KA).~~ The review period has now passed.

### Important Dates

- Reviewer signup deadline: September 29th, 2021, AoE
- Assignments of reviewers to papers (start of review phase): October 1st, 2021
- Active discussion between junior & senior reviewers: October 1st to 15th, 2021
- First draft of review by junior reviewers: October 8th, 2021
- **Final reviewing deadline**: October 15th, 2021, AoE

### Reviewing Guidelines
We encourage all reviewers, both junior and senior, to check [our reviewing guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRdY8e2ttALw_kzxviejrhkVkiJlJ7YiS3yGm9jykB0/edit). 

### Reviewing Mentorship

Last year we trialed a new reviewer mentorship scheme aiming to improve the future pool of expert reviewers in machine learning. 61 Junior reviewers provided reviews guided by 39 senior reviewers, who gave them feedback and advice throughout the reviewing process. The program was a success with lots of discussion behind the scenes, and we're excited to renew the program this year.

If you would like to sign up, or recommend somebody, to be either a junior or senior reviewer, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAWp5swQk0fFP_QN9Agv5WlMWqmoVrP53ygmxLMKpuajjBVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) by 29 September 2021.

Additionally, all submissions will be asked to provide **two** contacts who have agreed to review for the workshop. These volunteers can, of course, be authors of the submission, or people who have agreed to review on behalf of the authors. Depending on their experience reviewing, these contacts will be assigned to either a junior or senior reviewer role. All submissions will be ensured at least one senior reviewer, since we will still be directly recruiting for reviewers as in previous years.
